	irker - submission tools for IRC notifications

irkerd is a specialized IRC client that runs as a daemon, allowing 
other programs to ship IRC notifications by sending JSON objects to a 
listening socket. 

It is meant to be used by hook scripts in version-control
repositories, allowing them to send commit notifications to project
IRC channels.  A hook script, irkerhook.py, supporting git, hg, and
Subversion is included in the distribution; see the install.adoc file
for installation instructions.

The advantage of using this daemon over individual scripted sends 
is that it can maintain connection state for multiple channels,
avoiding obnoxious join/leave spam.

The file install.adoc describes how to install the software safely, so
it can't be used as a spam conduit.

Please read the files security.adoc and hacking.adoc before modifying
this code.
